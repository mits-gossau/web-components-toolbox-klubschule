Deviation Design - UI

Decision of 30 April 2024: The Custom Select will not be implemented according to the design in a first step. Instead, the Web Api select will be provided in the best possible way to ensure functionality. In a second step, a decision will be made as to whether the custom select, including the associated additional work, will be delivered subsequently in a separate ticket.
